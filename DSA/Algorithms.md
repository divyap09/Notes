### Online Algorithms:
<ul>
  <li>only piece-wise information is available at the moment and the future information is not known yet</li>
  <li>makes decisions based on past data</li>
  <li>eg. Insertion sort</li>
</ul>



### Offline Algorithms:
<ul>
  <li>the entire input is known before hand.</li>
</ul>

eg. Merge sort
